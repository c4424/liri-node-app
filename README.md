# liri-node-app
this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


To use Liri you must open the directory in which liri.js is located in the command line, then then choose one of the four possible paremters:

## concert-this
Type node liri concert-this then an artist's name
this will show information about different venues, the venue's name and location.

## do-what-it-says
Type node liri do-what-it-says
