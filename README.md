# liri-node-app
this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


To use Liri you must open the directory in which liri.js is located in the command line, then then choose one of the four possible paremters:

concert-this
Type node liri concert-this then an artist's name
this will show information about different venues, the venue's name and location.

spotify-this-song
Type node liri spotify-this-song then a song's name
This will display the artist name, the song name, a preview link and the album name.

movie-this
Type node liri movie-this then a movie name
The command will display information about the movie such as the title, release date, IMDB rating.

do-what-it-says
Type node liri do-what-it-says
Unlike the other commands, do-what-it-says does not take in a term. This command will read the content inside the random.txt file which is "spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"". It will take will the spotify-this-song command and use I Want it That Way from the random.txt file as a term.
